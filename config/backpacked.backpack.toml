		# Possible Functions:
		# LINEAR_INTERPOLATION - This will count how many slots/bays are unlocked plus one and divide it by the
		#                        maximum unlockable slots/bays. For example, if 10 out of 20 slots are unlocked,
		#                        a value of 11 divided by 20 will be evaluated and that will equal 0.55 or 55%.
		#                        A cost value is then picked out of the customCosts list at the position that
		#                        represents 55% percent of the lists length. So if customCosts contained 20 values, it
		#                        will be picking the 11th value. The formula is custom_costs_length * ((unlocked_count + 1) / total_unlockable).
		#                        (See below for real examples)
		# INDEX_WITH_CLAMP     - This option will exactly match the next unlock count to an index in the customCosts
		#                        list. For example, if 10 out of 20 slots are unlocked, the next unlock count will
		#                        be 11, so the 11th value in the custom costs list will be used as the cost to
		#                        unlock the next slot/bay. This option will safely handle cases where if the 11th value
		#                        doesn't exist, due the custom costs list containing less than 11 values, the last
		#                        value in the list will be selected. (See below for real examples)
		# 
		# Examples:
		# 1. Backpack has 27 unlockable slots, and this option is set to INDEX_WITH_CLAMP. The custom costs
		# list contains the values [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10]. This is interpreted as "the first five unlock costs
		# will be 5, all the remaining will cost 10".
		# 
		# 2. Backpack has 3 unlockable augment bays, and this option is set to INDEX_WITH_CLAMP. The custom
		# cost lists contains the values [5, 10, 15]. This is interpreted as "the first augment bay will
		# cost 5, the second will cost 10, and the final will cost 15".
		# 
		# 3. Backpack has 18 unlockable slots, and this option is set to LINEAR_INTERPOLATION. The custom costs
		# list contains the values [1, 100]. This is interpreted as "the first nine unlock costs will
		# cost 1, then the final nine will cost 100".
		# 
		# 4. Backpack has 9 unlockable slots, and this option is set to LINEAR_INTERPOLATION, and the custom costs
		# list contains the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Since the count of the unlockable slots (9) and the
		# length of the customCosts list (9) are the exact same, the first unlock cost will be 1, the
		# second 2, the third 3, and so on until 9. However, if you bumped the backpack to 18 unlockable slots,
		# this would then change to, the first two unlock costs will be 1, the next two unlock costs will be 2, the
		# following two unlock costs will be 3.
		# 
		# Note from MrCrayfish:
		# This may seem confusing (and it is), but just play around with this config property. Always start with a
		# fresh backpack everytime you change this property, or you may not see how the property affects the selection
		# process. I suggest starting with LINEAR_INTERPOLATION and then adding enough values to the customCosts list
		# so it matches the number of slots in the backpack (so if the backpack has 54 slots, put 54 values into customCosts).
		# Once you've tried that, half the number of values in customCosts (so if 54 slots, put 27 values into customCosts)
		# and this will give you an understanding of how the function works. Then afterwards, try INDEX_WITH_CLAMP but set
		# the values [1, 2, 3] as the customCosts. You will see the first unlock cost 1, the second cost 2, and every other
